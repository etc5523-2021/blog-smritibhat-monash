## Introduction

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It began spreading in earnest in the early 2020's and has led to a global crisis of never-seen before proportions. People are being forced to stay indoors to reduce risk of exposure and spread of the disease.

Algeria, a country in the Northern part of Africa has also had to endure this crisis.

This blog post is aimed at investigating how the government has battled the crisis and whether the circuit-breaker measures actually did what they were supposed to.

## Data Description

Data sets used in this report come from two main sources - 

1.    Collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data).
2.    [COVID-19 Government Measures Dataset](https://www.acaps.org/covid-19-government-measures-dataset) by ACAPS.

It contains a collection of data with `r length(covid_stats)` variables for COVID-19 dataset.
The data is available from `r covid_stats_algeria$date[1]` to `r covid_stats_algeria$date[550]` upon filtering for Algeria. The data sets are then filtered to select only the appropriate variables. Out of 62 variables in the COVID-19 dataset, only 5 were selected while 8 out of the 18 variables in the government measures dataset were selected. These tables are then merged together using the full join technique to get our final working dataset.

**Descriptions of variables**
```{r}

k <- data.frame(Variables = names(covid_algeria),
                Description = c("Date values",
                                "New cases recorded on date",
                                "New deaths recorded on date",
                                "Measures types and categories",
                                "Description of measure taken with further details",
                                "Source organization",
                                "Link to source website"))

paged_table(k, options = list(rows.print = 5, cols.print = 2))
  
```

## Numerical Summary Statistics

Two variables of the dataset **new_cases** and **new_deaths** show a large range of values that need to be analysed. The summary of their distribution statistics is visible in the table below -

**Summary Statistics**
```{r}
statistics <- data.frame(
  Variables = c("new_cases", "new_deaths"),
  Mean = c(mean(covid_algeria$new_cases, na.rm = TRUE),
                mean(covid_algeria$new_deaths, na.rm = TRUE)),
  SD = c(sd(covid_algeria$new_cases, na.rm = TRUE),
                  sd(covid_algeria$new_deaths, na.rm = TRUE)),
  `Maximum Value` = c(max(covid_algeria$new_cases, na.rm = TRUE),
                      max(covid_algeria$new_deaths, na.rm = TRUE))
  )
paged_table(statistics)
```

## Effect of Policy Measures

The below table gives an opportunity to take a look at the various policy measures taken by the government of Algeria over the pandemic and see whether those have borne fruit. The sparkline plots display the occurrence of new cases and deaths on a daily basis for 2 weeks post the measure being taken.

<aside> The period of two weeks is taken as a supposed period for measures as this period has been termed as a circuit breaker. </aside>

```{r}

new_cases_range <- function(date2){
  test <- covid_algeria %>%
    filter(date >= as.Date(date2, origin = "1899-12-30") &
             date <= as.Date(date2, origin = "1899-12-30") + 14)
  return(test$new_cases)
}

new_deaths_range <- function(date2){
  test <- covid_algeria %>%
    filter(date >= as.Date(date2, origin = "1899-12-30") &
             date <= as.Date(date2, origin = "1899-12-30") + 14)
  return(test$new_deaths)
}

covid_measures <- covid_algeria[!is.na(covid_algeria$MEASURE),]
covid_measures <- covid_measures %>%
  mutate(Date = date(date))

covid_measures %>%
  select(Date, MEASURE) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(cases_trend = spk_chr(new_cases_range(Date),
                               type = "line",
                               chartRangeMin=0,
                               chartRangeMax=max(covid_algeria$new_cases)),
         Outcome = list(ifelse(
           new_cases_range(Date)[1] < new_cases_range(Date)[length(new_cases_range(Date))],
           fa("arrow-alt-circle-up", fill = "#B22222"),
           fa("arrow-alt-circle-down", fill = "#9ACD32"))),
         death_trend = spk_chr(new_deaths_range(Date),
                               type = "line",
                               chartRangeMin=0,
                               chartRangeMax=max(covid_algeria$new_cases)),
         Outcome_2 = list(ifelse(
           new_deaths_range(Date)[1] < new_deaths_range(Date)[length(new_deaths_range(Date))],
           fa("arrow-alt-circle-up", fill = "#B22222"),
           fa("arrow-alt-circle-down", fill = "#9ACD32")))) %>%
  datatable(escape = FALSE,
            rownames = FALSE,
            colnames = c("Date", "Measures Undertaken", "New Cases", "Trend",
                         "Daily Deaths", "Trend"),
            caption = htmltools::tags$caption(
              style = 'caption-side: top; text-align: left;',
              htmltools::h4('Effect of Policy Measures'),
              htmltools::h5('Line plots display the statistics for daily cases and deaths for 2 weeks post measure undertaken.')),
            class = list(display = "hover"),
            options = list(search = list(regex = TRUE),
                           searchHighlight = TRUE,
                           scrollY = "300px",
                           scrollCollapse = TRUE,
                           paging = FALSE,
                           dom = "ft",
                           fnDrawCallback = htmlwidgets::JS(
  '
function(){
  HTMLWidgets.staticRender();
}
'
))) %>%
  formatStyle("Date","white-space"="nowrap") %>% 
  spk_add_deps()
  
  
```

While we don't see clear evidence of these measures being completely successful in every case, here are some generalizations that can be gathered - 

1.    Partial Lockdowns have been held more often and are more likely to act as a circuit breaker than a full lockdown. 2/3 Full lockdowns have been unsuccessful. Partial lockdowns, international flights suspension and limiting public gatherings have a 50% chance of success. These also have lower economic impact so except for dire circumstances, they seem like a better choice to take.
2.    Requirement to wear protective gear in public has seen positive results in 2/3 cases which seems to indicate that **masks-on** is one of the best strategies.
3.    Economic measures have borne fruit in 3/4 cases and showed a downward trend.
4.    Domestic travel restrictions have shown success in 4/7 cases. Limiting mobility seems to be a more effective strategy than completely shutting it down.
5.    Closing schools has not seemed to help either as there was only one registered decline in cases post that out of the 5 instances in which the action was taken. A similar outcome is seen in the case of -

    -    Border checks and closures
    -    Closure of businesses and public services
    -    Awareness campaigns
    -    Curfews
    
6.    Isolation and Quarantine policies seem to have no effect in impeding the spread of the disease.
7.    Algeria has even seen military deployment and checkpoints within the country to impede the spread. While it does display a momentary sharp decline in this case, the overarching trend is that the value at the end of two weeks for daily cases was still higher than the first day.

## Conclusions

From the above table and data it is visible that none of the measures can be described as a resounding and monumental success. Further exploration is needed to check whether combinations of the more successful measures out of these would be able to succeed in a more complete fashion in combating the spread of the virus.

## Improvements

The following improvements can be made to the blog post -

1.    The measures can be factored in a weighted manner for a more appropriate result.
2.    The actual duration that these measures lasted is not given and might be necessary to make a more correct judgement as to why these circuit breakers may not have given the results that were expected from.
