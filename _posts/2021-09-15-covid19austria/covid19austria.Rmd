## Introduction

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. It began spreading in earnest in the early 2020's and has led to a global crisis of never-seen before proportions. People are being forced to stay indoors to reduce risk of exposure and spread of the disease.

Austria, a country in the Europe has also had to endure this crisis.

This blog post is aimed at investigating a few key articles that became breaking news during the time and checking the veracity of their claims.

## The First Article

```{r data1}

wave1 <- tibble(Country = c("Austria", "Iceland", "Denmark", "Norway", "Finland", "Germany"),
                Cases = c(1, 8, 4, 10, 6, 14),
                Dates = c("07/03/2020", "04/03/2020", "08/03/2020", "09/03/2020", "09/03/2020", "12/03/2020"),
                lat = c(47.516232, 64.963051, 56.263920, 60.472023, 61.924110, 51.1657),
                long = c(14.550072, -19.020836, 9.501785, 8.468946, 25.748152, 10.4515),
                lat_from = c(47.516232, 47.516232, 47.516232, 47.516232, 47.516232, 47.516232),
                long_from = c(14.550072, 14.550072, 14.550072, 14.550072, 14.550072, 14.550072),)


covid_stats <- read_csv("../../data/owid-covid-data.csv")
```



```{r map1}
key = "pk.eyJ1Ijoic21yaXRpYmhhdC1tb25hc2giLCJhIjoiY2t0anJjZW50MG41djJ3cW40cGpkMnp3eCJ9.trgg-yv2Femn9glwxksBVQ"

wave1 <- wave1 %>%
  mutate(cases_text = paste0("Number of cases: ", Cases))

mapdeck(token = key, style = mapdeck_style("light"), pitch = 85 ) %>%
  add_arc(
    data = wave1,
    layer_id = "arc_layer",
    origin = c("long_from", "lat_from"),
    destination = c("long", "lat"),
    stroke_from = "#FFB344",
    stroke_to = "#00A19D",
    stroke_width = 10,
    tooltip = "cases_text",
    auto_highlight = TRUE
  ) %>%
  add_title(title = "Spread of Covid-19 from Ground Zero", layer_id = "title")
```

```{r viz2}

covid_stats_eu <- covid_stats %>%
  filter(location %in% wave1$Country) %>%
  select(date, new_cases, new_deaths, location) %>%
  filter(date <= "2020-04-05")

cols <- c("#FFB400", "#FFC740", "#C20008", "#FF020D", "#13AFEF", "#4276ac")

p <- ggplot(covid_stats_eu, aes(date, new_cases, fill = location, label = new_cases)) +
  geom_stream(color = 1, lwd = 0.25, bw = 1) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cols) +
  theme_minimal()


ggplotly(p)

```



## The Second Article


```{r}
covid_stats_au_1 <- covid_stats %>%
  filter(location == "Austria") %>%
  select(date, new_cases, new_deaths) %>%
  filter(date >= "2020-11-06" & date <= "2020-12-06")

covid_stats_au_2 <- covid_stats %>%
  filter(location == "Austria") %>%
  select(date, new_cases, new_deaths) %>%
  filter(date >= "2020-12-06")
```

```{r}

```
