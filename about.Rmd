I was previously employed as a software developer in Wipro Limited for 2 years. With a broad skillset from R to Python and Tableau, I am looking forward to more opportunities to enhance my experience in these areas.

I am heavily invested in learning visualization and analytics. I am passionate about innovative ways to present data as well as finding patterns that might be buried otherwise.
